The Let used a capital L instead of a lowercase l, the assignment of reopenDate needed another quotation mark, and the variable should have been midnight tonight rather than september 8th as to conform to the example in the book. -->

The second mistake was that the reopenDate variable used a lowercase d rather than capital D. the third mistake is that brackets were used instead of parentheses. the fourth mistake is that the commenting was incorrectly formatted so the entire script element was commented out. -->
